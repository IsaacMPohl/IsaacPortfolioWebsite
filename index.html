                    Hello, my name is Isaac Pohl and I am a junior in high school. I attend Gibson Southern High School and Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center; 
                     where I take the computer science class. I really enjoy computer science because it is challenging and offers many opportunities to learn. I am also in advanced 
                      math which I believe is very important in developing the mindset of a successful person. Outside of class I am always looking for ways to learn
                       and be involved in the community. I am a member of Gibson Southern FFA, Vanderburgh County Junior Leaders, and SICTC BPA. For each of these clubs, I
                        have earned many awards at the local and state levels. I also participate in cross country and track & field at Gibson Southern. Currently, I am employed at
                         Pohl's Ag Services which is a company that helps farmers analyze crops yields.  In 2023, during the summer, I am going to collect plant samples and create a database for the farm with the data I collected for further 
                          analysis them. In 2023, I was one of twelve students who was picked in the United States to be part of the National Precision Agriculture Team. This required me to teach 
                          a drone program to youth in Southern Indiana. I have educated approximently 200 youth on the importance of drone usage in agriculture. Another outstanding accomplishment which I have 
                          has been owning a greenhouse.  I was awarded an FFA Professional Award  and a $1,000 grant from Bob Evan's to expand my greenhouse business.
