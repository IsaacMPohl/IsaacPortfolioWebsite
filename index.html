                    I am Isaac Pohl and am a Junior in High School this year. I go to Gibson Southern High School and Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center; 
                     where I take the computer science class. I really enjoy computer science because it is challenging and so much to learn. I am also in advanced 
                      math which I believe is very important in developing the mindset of a successful person. Outside of class I am always looking for ways to learn
                       and being involved in the community. I am involved in Gibson Southern FFA, Vanderburgh County Junior Leaders, and SICTC BPA. Each of these I
                        have earned many awards in competitions and for going beyond the average. I also participate in cross country and track & field. My main job
                         includes working for Pohl's Ag services which is a company that helps farmers analyze crops along with farmers goal to help maximize the farms
                          success. In 2023 during the summer I am going to collect plant samples and create a database for the farm with the data I collected for further 
                          analysis. In 2023 I was one of 12 which was picked by the US to be part of the National Precision Agriculture Team. This required me to teach 
                          a program to 50 youth after being touched, but I went beyond and touched this to more than 200 youth. Another big accomplishment which I have 
                          has been owning a greenhouse which I was awarded a FFA professional award for and a $1000 grant from bob evan to expand my business.
