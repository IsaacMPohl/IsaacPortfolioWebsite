                <h3>Pohl's Ag Services (2020-present)</h3>
                <p>I worked for Pohl's Ag Services starting in 2020 which was covid year. 
                    I was so excited when I started here because my brother worked at this company for  many years.
                    At first I worked alongside my boss to soil sample fields, fixing farmers maps for more accurate data analysis,
                    repairing equipment, helping analyze farmers fields, installing irrigation sensors, and installing weather stations. 
                    This past winter, I helped build a new building for the business. This summer I will have much more independence and will be 
                    assigned to go to different fields to do many of these same tasks along with a new project which I will be in
                    charge of.  This involves collecting leaf samples of corn for farmers and analyzing the data. I love working for this company and 
                    I will be a great help to this company to grow essentially in the digital world in the future. 
                </p>
                <h3>Pohl's GreenHouse</h3>
                <div id="greenhouse" alt="greenhouse"></div>
                <p>I started in 2020 a small hobby greenhouse where I grew plants for my family. Over the years I expanded my company. 
                    I learned some of the most important life lessons while working on this business.
                    In 2022 I grew and sold $700 worth of plants, this year I sold $900 worth of plants. 
                    Below is my SAE proficiency award application which I received 1st placed in the State FFA Convention.

                <h3>Pohl's Farms(2019-2021)</h3>
                <p>This was my very first job. My brother also worked for the farmer (Steve Pohl)
                     in years past.  Steve and he is related to my family (my Dad's Cousin).
                      I was very determined to prove myself by showing up to work on time
                       and working my hardest. This job was tough and included cleaning grain bins out, taking down buildings, 
                       feeding hogs, shoveling gravel, moving water containers, farming and many other duties. This job was my most stressful 
                       job I have ever had. I was 15 years old and harvesting  the fields with a John Deere Combine. 
                        The days required long hours and I couldn't stop to think about what to do because as Steve reminded me countless times each
                         minute wastes hundreds of dollars. Along with harvesting, I operated the grain cart and cultivator.

                <h3>Kuester Landscaping(2019-2020)</h3>
                <p>These are the years in which I worked for a landscaping company. This company was small but required hard work and dedication especially on hot days.
                     My tasks included push mowing, trimming bushes, picking weeds, and helping decide on landscaping needs for the customer.
                      One important thing which I learned from this company is that as a business owner you need to put customers first. 
                </p>
                <h3>Pohl's Pumpkin</h3>
                <p>This is also my other business which I started in 2015.
                     At first I grew pumpkins on a Â¼ acre plot in my parents' garden. In 2020 when I decided to partner up with my cousin, 
                     this allowed us to grow pumpkins on a 1 acre plot at his house. We quickly opened up a website and facebook page for advertisement.
                      In 2023 we decided to stop growing pumpkins since my cousin Ezra was going to college.
